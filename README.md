I used MacOS for these processes
1. Install Webstorm at https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ \
   	a. You need to verify that you are currently in school to get it for free. (You might need your school id) \
    b. Link the liscence to your account and download webstorm from the multiplt other applications
2. Install git from with the instructions from https://git-scm.com/download/mac \
    a. Install homebrew from https://brew.sh/ by putting /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" in your terminal\
    b. Then in your terminal use the command brew install git
3. Open webstorm that you have installed \
    a. It will automatically find and select the git you installed in version control \
    b. Create a new Project and now you have a local repository
